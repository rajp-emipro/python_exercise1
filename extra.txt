12}{Q-31}students = {'Aex':{'class':'V', 'roll_id':2}, 'Puja':{'class':'V',â€™roll_id':3}}
Using the above dictionary, print the following output.
Aex
class : V
roll_id : 2
Puja
class : V
roll_id : 3

                        and also {of question 31}

can we use items instead of info in 2nd loop?
according to below mentioned solution?
for name,info in students.items():      #1st loop
    print(name)
    for key in info:                    #2nd loop
        print(f"{key}:{info[key]}")
